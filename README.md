Finch Robot Application

This project is an application created using The Snap! graphical programming environment to create a prototype robot. The robot prototype in this project is meant to be the beginnings of a pet toy robot. This robot has a command to start and stop. It uses light and infrared sensors which are connected to the wheel actuators. The dominant sensors are the light sensors which detect obstacles. Once an obstacle is detected the robot will stop, back up, change direction, and start again. The second sensors are infrared for situations where light is impaired. The infrared sensors are programmed to perform the same task as the light sensors. The combination of these sensors will provide a pet toy that will not get stuck on obstacles, making it a superior product choice for the pet market.
